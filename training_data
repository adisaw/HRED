Say , <person> , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? </s> You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . </s> What do you mean ?

I hear <person> and <person> often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . </s> Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us .

She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . </s> You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? </s> We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she would let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . </s> That sounds like a good idea . I will have to try that . </s>
